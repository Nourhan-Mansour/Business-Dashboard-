  Business Dashboard

 Project Overview

This is a full data analysis project using **Power BI**. The goal is to see how an E-commerce business is working (its performance).

The dashboard helps us turn the data into clear information so we can make better and faster decisions about sales, shipping, and customer happiness.

 Dashboard Structure

The dashboard has three main pages for detailed analysis:

 1. Overview Page

* Focus: Main business numbers and overall performance.
* Key KPIs: Total Sales ($7.44M), Average Order Value, and Total Freight.
* Good Result: We see a high 92.1% On-time Delivery Rate, which is great for shipping.
* Sales Focus: Shows the Top 10 Products and where sales happen on the map.

 2. Customer Page

* Focus:** How customers act and if they are satisfied.
* Customer Groups:** We look at monthly money (Revenue) made from different customer groups (VIP, Regular, New).
* Main Insight: The VIP segment makes the most money, so we need to focus on keeping them.
* Satisfaction: We check the number of reviews by score and also see what customers wrote (Customer Comment Summary).

 3. Products & Sellers Page

* Focus: Checking the performance of products and the people who sell them.
* Product Sales: Detailed sales view for each product category.
* Top Sellers: Shows the Top 10 Sellers by total sales amount.
* Quality Check: This page links the sales of the seller to the quality of their reviews.

  Tools Used

* Software Power BI Desktop
* Skills: Data Modeling, DAX language, Power Query (for cleaning data)
